### Notes

- Tutorial videos provided are somewhat out of date. Begins by instructing to initiate a project in C, then remainder of tutorials are in Swift
- XCode looks substantially different in terms of UI/buttonology than version in videos. Required some Google Fu
- Doesn't address API keys in codebase
